Recently I was listening to a [Shop Talk Show episode](https://shoptalkshow.com/549/) where they were discussing the new [JSON5](https://json5.org/) format. I had never heard of JSON5 before, so I decided to do some research and write this article to share what I learned.

JSON5 is a superset of JSON that aims to make it easier to write and read. It is a human-readable format that is also valid JSON. JSON5 is a proposed standard, but it is not yet an official standard. It is currently being developed by the JSON5 Working Group.

While you shouldn't use JSON5 for machine-to-machine communication, it is a great format for configuration files and other human-readable data. Why shouldn't you use it for machine-to-machine communication though? Since a machine generated format can easily adhere to the stricter JSON standard, it is better to use the stricter standard for wider support.
